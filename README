A custom theme I developed for Blue & White <http://www.unc.edu/bw/>, a monthly 
magazine at UNC, with some custom features designed specifically for its usage.  
Code based on WordPress 3.0's default theme, Twenty Ten.  Appearance, less so.

Uses Jan Sorgalla's jCarousel <http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/>.

Special features:
- Page templates for issue archives and individual issues.
- Feature photos for pages (684 by 150 pixels), using WordPress post 
  thumbnails.  These photos can also be displayed in a front page "featured 
  content" carousel, configured through the theme options.
- Spot colors that change the basis color of the theme on a per-page basis, 
  using a #rrggbb hex triplet in a custom field named "spotcolor".  If no spot 
  color is configured for a specific page, it looks for one in its ancestors, 
  and then falls back to a default specified in the theme options.
- Author names can be overridden by using a custom field named "author"; the 
  special value "@none" disables bylines on pages.
